> A **decision tree** is a [decision support](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_support_system) tool that uses a [tree-like](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_(graph_theory)) [model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causal_model) of decisions and their possible consequences, including [chance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability) event outcomes, resource costs, and [utility](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utility). It is one way to display an [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm) that only contains conditional control statements.

> Decision trees are commonly used in [operations research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operations_research), specifically in [decision analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_analysis), to help identify a strategy most likely to reach a [goal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goal), but are also a popular tool in [machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree_learning).
